### What do I want to learn or understand better?

**Now:**  
I know have a better understanding of the different parts of the Scrum methodology, Backlog, User Stories, Definition of Done, Sprints, Testing, ... .  

I have also together with the group started applying it. We are also better understanding what the MPV is and what is needed of the product as well as how it should be done. Although it is still a bit rough because this is all an incremental process.

Decide the initial prototype structure and looks and begin implementation. 
Define tasks that can be done to get the project up as a website. 
Get familiar and comfortable with the use of Scrum. 
Get experience in how to estimate the coming tasks by listening to the groups opinions.

#### What do I want to learn or understand better? 

Currently the project is not well-defined, I have a weak understanding of the scrum methodology and I’m part of a new group. 

I want to better understand and outline the project and its scope and requirements.  I also want to better understand the scrum methodology. Lastly, I also want to get to know the group and together with them develop a creative, curious and idea friendly atmosphere with constructive but well-meaning critique as well as find out what role I should take in this group. 

To reach this I will discuss the project ideas with the group, participate in meetings and contribute with at least one project idea. Additionally, I will stay on track with the course material and do the required readings in order to apply the Scrum methods. Finally, I will be me mindful, attentive and positive to get to know this group, understand its needs and how I can help the group communication and dynamics flourish. 

#### How can I help someone or the entire team to learn something new? 

Through discussion, openness and sharing/listening to what other group members think and know. To give concrete feedback and help nurture a curious and experimental atmosphere where ideas will flourish. Especially in the beginning of the project. 

#### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? 

Participating in the initial process and contributing to create a good team dynamic and quickly start the initial phase of the project. Staying up to date on the project status and what the other members have done as well as the course content. 

#### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

An open mindset and possible ideas for projects. Participating in meetings, preparing the social contract with the others and preparing the agreed to use tools for the project. Studying the course material and avoiding work on weekends.
